The _DAI Stablecoin System_ incentivizes external agents, called _keepers_,
to automate certain operations around the Ethereum blockchain.

`cdp-keeper` is responsible for actively monitoring and managing open CDPs.
At the beginning it was capable only of topping them up if they get too close
to the liquidation level, but now more advances paths are being developed
(like automatically wiping the debt instead of topping-up, managing the SAI
volume within specific range etc.). **This keeper is still under development.**

It only monitors cups owned by the `--eth-from` account. Cups owned by other
accounts are ignored.

# Example

If the CDP collateralization ratio goes below `--min-margin` and at the same time the debt is greater than `--max-sai`, it tries to `wipe` some debt targeting `--avg-sai`. if wiping that debt didn't help to bring collateralization ratio above `--min-margin` (or it wasn't possible to `wipe` at all for some reason, for example the keeper didn't have any Dai), it then tries to `lock` some extra collateral in order to bring collateralization ratio at least to `--top-up-margin`

Both `--min-margin` and `--top-up-margin` are expressed as on top of the current liquidation ratio configured.

If liquidation ratio is `1.50` (= 150%), then if you set `--min-margin 1.0` it will try to top-up if below 250%
